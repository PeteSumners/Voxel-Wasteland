weapon vendor NPCs (for weapons and things): PauseUnpause
- can buy/sell weapons/ammo/armor with these guys
- random, finite items
- change their inventory every once in a while

buildables:
- don't do regular block building
- have pre-built structures that players can drop
- then things aren't OP
- have dirt grenades to fill holes/make other players stuck/protect yourself from explosions and things. don't make dirt grenades suffocate people: just make them surround the immediate area with dirt, excluding enemies (like pocket tanks!)

speaking of tanks...
Vehicles:
- buyable/customizable vehicles
- like planetside
- can get in a tank
- or a technical type vehicle
- or a jetpack
- or a droppable turret
- or a rocket! (to space! or at least really high so that you can do an orbital drop in a drop-pod). So, a rocket/drop pod combo. That would actually be lit. You could put a warhead on it or a drop-pod like I was originally saying. 
- And you could put a drone/weapons in the drop-pod. Or other players. Whatever. ICBM tech + weapons cache + transport. Awesome. 
- or a plane
- make them all out of voxels, and have cool explosions for when they blow up. 
- don't have buildable vehicles: have discrete customization options so things aren't crazy complicated

What else does pocket tanks have?
- mountain mover (no damage, but levels ground/obstacles): can have it only affect natural ground so that buildable structures stay standing
- jack hammer
- skipper
- range finder bullet things (just have a normal range finder)
- physics for dirt (dirt falls when there's nothing below it): that's actually important

rescue beacon (for calling a rescue ship)
non-covert communication (NCC): radio beacon
very covert communication (VCC): laser beam
direct/global text chat for saying "[RESCUE SHIP]: REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGED"
or "Weapons cache found at (-47, 118)!"
or "Damaged mech found at (342, 400)!"
or "Air drop coming in 10 minutes at (100, 385). Capture the LZ to take it!"

aircraft
paragliders
self-destructing drones

hacking: 
- can hack into systems if you get physical access to them
- go into system with pre-programmed commands, or just wing it
- can use data knife to hack into systems (like titanfall)
- or you can try radio signals, but that won't give you auto-pwn status
- commands to implement: cd, ls, edit (to edit files), run (to run files), shutdown (to shutdown system)
- can program drones to target hackable things with radio signals (like other drones, for instance)
- data knife is exclusive to players
- EMPs can shutdown stuff that isn't properly faraday-caged
Ok, actually, don't do linux-type hacking. Just make "hacking modules" that you can shoot out of a special gun. Different modules have different success chances/hacking types/costs. Drones can also be made resistant (or impervious) to hacking, and if you miss, you'll have to retrieve your module, so be careful! 
Drones have owners, and the owners have access to a menu that allows you to change the drone's settings. If your drone is hacked, you lose access to your drone! 
Drones are super vulnerable to EMPs, so watch out! 
Drones with the "hardwired" attribute can't be hacked. But hardwired drones are more expensive. 
Hacking modules don't have to hack stuff. They can also just fry a drone's circuits to make it unusable. The success rate for a hacking module depends on its type. More expensive modules have a higher base success rate. Jammer modules can be cheap and relatively successful (for frying a drone), but they don't give you any real control over a drone. 

Shields:
can have shield modules for players
or shield modules for drones
or shield modules for locations/bases!
can be pierced with explosives/melee weapons/hacking modules (anything slow and massive)
stop bullets/plasma weapons, though (small/light/fast stuff).
easy to deactivate with plasma weapons
totally deactivated by EMPs
require a power generator. Better generators mean better regen times. Better shields mean higher damage capacity. 
They glow, so you can't be as sneaky with them. 

Cloak:
make you invisible (kind of)
shields will still be visible, so don't use them with a cloaking device
totally deactivated by EMPs

Drones:
attached to a single player
can be customized at a drone factory (or maybe they're just part of a certain loadout)
options:
- varying levels of armor for different kinds of weapons: low cal, high cal, explosives
- tradeoffs for armor: slower movement, higher cost
- can be upgraded/bought at a drone factory in-game (so you don't have to build a loadout just for a drone: you can get one later)
- can have multiple drones attached to a player. But cap it at a certain amount (maybe 3 or something) (or maybe 10!) IDK. Test stuff out. 

Loadouts:
- get a certain amount of cash to build a starting loadout with
- can earn more money to buy more/better stuff as you progress
- better stuff costs more. 
- example: you could build a loadout with like one pistol (cheap), very little and very poor ammo (also cheap), but have an awesome drone sidekick with explosive-grade armor (to protect the drone and allow the player to hide behind it for cover), an awesome power generator (for fast speed), a shield (to make it even harder to kill/hack) and a good gun (because yeah). and then make the drone be like a body guard for the player, just following, dealing with threats, and providing a means of cover. 
- other example: no drone, but have a rocket launcher + jetpack + cloaking system. deadly
- other example: none of that, but have a decent weapon, decent armor and a wrench to repair mechs/vehicles with
- varying levels of armor. affects player mass, which affects player move speed, explosion speed and jetpack accel. 


Weapons/equipment (loadouts, cont.):
- terrain regenerator: player has to stand still to activate it. Regenerates terrain back to its natural state AROUND the player/other entities. Use it to be hide stuff inside terrain (be sneaky) or just to regen ugly terrain (be cool). 
- terrain digger. dig terrain without explosions. Useful for making tunnels and things. 
- shootable cameras. Type of cheap drone. Cycle through them like you would any other drone to see what they can see. Can move/change direction for better viewing. Small, so difficult to detect. Combine them with terrain regenerator to be super sneaky. 
- hacking module. Also type of drone. Use them to disable/take control of other drones. 
- satellites. Type of drone. Launch them from rockets, and view the map from space. Can also shoot lasers/missiles down to at ground or at other satellites. Can also drop weapons caches/drop pods from space. Shoot them down with lasers/rockets. 
- x-ray vision. activate it to see players/drones/other stuff through terrain. Attachable to drones. Useful against sneaky players. Also useful for sneaky players. 

Day/night cycle:
- add this because it's cool
- add monsters (zombies, other crazy stuff) to come out at night
- add thermal monoculars/scopes to help players see at night
- add night vision, too

EMPs:
- deactivate everything electrical in their range, including friendly stuff (drones, plasma weapons, electrical player stuff like cloaks/shields/terrain regenerators/x-ray, vehicles, etc)
- super duper expensive
- wide range
- really useful for dudes who rely on electrical stuff
- don't work on players themselves, normal (mechanical) guns, rockets/grenades, NPCs, etc
- EMP'd stuff can be repaired/reactivated with a wrench. 

Hacking modules:
- type of drone
- hack other drones with it
- totally useless on its own
- it breaks if it hits anything that isn't a drone, so you better have really good aim
- expensive
- will work on enemy vehicles/turrets that aren't hardwired (so you can turn enemy stuff off or even friendly)
- shoot it out of a special gun
- can be removed by other players (with a wrench) so that they can retake their stuff
- if a hacking module hits an object that's already been hacked, both modules will be destroyed, and the object will enter an EMP'd state until it's repaired. 
- if it hits a "hardwired" object, it'll be destroyed like if it hit the ground.
