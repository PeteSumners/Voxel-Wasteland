# TODO: have interactable objects on side of table
# when player interacts (F) with a gun part, put that part on the table. 
# when player interacts with several compatible parts, put all of them together
# when player interacts with a part that doesn't work with the current system, start over with the current part
# rotate/hover (sinusoid up and down) gun at a set rate for cool visual effect
# indicate that a gun is functional by having it do the rotate/hover thing instead of just sitting as a bunch of parts
# when player interacts with a well-formed (functional) firearm, give the gun to the player

# Declare member variables here. Examples:
# var a = 2
# var b = "text"


# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	pass # Replace with function body.


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
#func _process(delta):
