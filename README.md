# Voxel-Wasteland
I'm working on a Godot project similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1eP4xY3KXI

## Controls
WASD - move around

Space - jump

Space (in air) - activate/use jetpack

WASD (while jetpack active) - move around in air!

Right-click - throw grenades

F - build blocks

## Quirks
You can't strafe in midair without activating your jetpack
